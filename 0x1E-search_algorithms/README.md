# INTRODUCTION
Search algorithms are procedures or a set of rules used to locate specific information or
items within a data structure or a collection of data.
They are used to search for a particular value in a given data structure.
The search algorithms are divided into two categories: sequential and interval.
This prpject covers some of the most popular search algorithms.

# types of search algorithms covered in this project:
- Linear search ex: [file: 0-linear.c](./0-linear.c)
- Binary search ex: [file: 1-binary.c](./1-binary.c)

# time complexity of the search algorithms covered in this project:
- Linear search: O(n)
- Binary search: O(log n)

# Objectives:
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs
